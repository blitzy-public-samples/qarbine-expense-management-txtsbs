- **Technical Specification Location**: [Technical Specification/5.1 Feature ID: F-001 Secure User Authentication](#)

### Route Registration and Service Integration

In `app.py`, route registration and service integration are handled:

```python
from flask import Flask
from src.routes import auth_routes, expense_routes, report_routes
from config import Config
from src.models import db

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(Config)

    # Initialize database
    db.init_app(app)

    # Register Blueprints
    app.register_blueprint(auth_routes)
    app.register_blueprint(expense_routes)
    app.register_blueprint(report_routes)

    # Additional service integrations can be added here

    return app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = create_app()
    app.run()
