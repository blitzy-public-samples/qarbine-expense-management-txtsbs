### Containerization

The application utilizes Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Containerization enhances portability, simplifies deployments, and improves resource utilization.

- **Docker Containers:** Encapsulate backend services, including the API server, policy engine, and notification service, ensuring they run uniformly across all environments.
- **Docker Compose:** Manages multi-container Docker applications, facilitating the orchestration of interconnected services during development and testing.
  
```bash
version: '3.8'
services:
  api-server:
    image: expense-tracker/api:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/expense_db
      - AWS_S3_BUCKET=expense-receipts
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=expense_db
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db-data:
```

### Orchestration

Kubernetes (AWS EKS) is employed for container orchestration, managing deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. Kubernetes ensures high availability, robustness, and efficient resource management across the infrastructure.

- **AWS EKS:** Provides a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies cluster management, security, and scalability.
- **Helm Charts:** Used for packaging Kubernetes resources, enabling repeatable and easy deployments of application components.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Configured to automatically adjust the number of running containers based on real-time demand and predefined metrics.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment of application code, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version Control**| GitHub                | Hosts the source code repository with branch management and pull request workflows.              |
| **Continuous Integration** | GitHub Actions / Jenkins | Automates code integration with automated builds, unit tests, and static code analysis on each commit. |
| **Artifact Management** | AWS ECR             | Stores Docker images securely, integrating with the CI pipeline for seamless container deployments. |
| **Continuous Deployment** | AWS CodePipeline    | Orchestrates the deployment process, including infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and application deployment using Helm. |
| **Automated Testing** | GitHub Actions / Jenkins | Executes automated integration and end-to-end tests to validate deployments before production release. |
| **Monitoring and Alerts** | AWS CloudWatch       | Monitors pipeline health and alerts the team on failures or issues during the CI/CD process.    |
